# sql-challenge

As a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard I have been asked to research employees from the 1980s and 19900s.
I will do this by creating a data base from the six remaining CSV files from that era.

First I created an initial design using genmymodel web resource link below and image in file.

Database creation instruction:

Step 1 - Create empty database

Step 2 - Run lines 1-46 of the schemas.sql

Step 3 - Import the csvs in the data folder in the following order:

    - departments
    - employees
    - salaries
    - titles
    - dept_managers
    - dept_emps

Requested queries can be run from query.sql

I suspect that April Foolsday not a real employee.
